Rombo Renderer
==============

Embree based path tracer with support for DOF, BRDF and area lights, together with tonemapping and basic .obj import. 
QT based GUI with advanced features like a resizable render region with one-click slots to save and compare prev renders on-the-fly (ie. like softimageXSI render region), a brush like mouse impl to 'paint' where renderer will focus its efforts, animated widgets with touch support (ie. custom num pad and sliders), advanced framebuffer able to render in-view only pixels while dealing with full resolution (ie. supports 16k res where only on-screen framebuffer pixels are actually rendered.. to test full resolution image parts without having to render the full image), thumbnails viewer that saves settings with it for easy switch.
